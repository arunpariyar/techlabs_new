Before deep neural networks ruled this competition the average error rate was way over 25%. Since then the error rate has been decreasing to less than 5%. The success of Deep Neural Networks relies on the huge amount of data that is necessary to train the millions of parameters. Since the amount of data is continuously increasing, the range of applications for AI becomes wider and deeper.
