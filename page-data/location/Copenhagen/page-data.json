At the moment, most CBS study lines do not allow students to choose technical IT electives because a clear link between the courses and business administration is required. However, the demand for business knowledge in combination with technical IT skills grows exponentially. ”You have probably heard about AI, Data Science, and Web Development, but how do you actually learn it? Apply for the TechLabs Digital Shaper Program and enroll in one of the three tracks! Here you will join a group of fellow ambitious students, participate in tech-related talks and workshops, and apply your skills in hands-on projects while being supported by our experienced mentors. Our corporate sponsor Milestone Systems and Accenture supplies us with expert-insights throughout the semester and has made sure that the online courses are free of charge. After completing your track and a final project you will receive a certificate and become a part of the TechLabs Copenhagen Alumni Network.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"firstEntryImage":{"id":"826fbe83-7ed0-5833-9da1-bf2be8cc65c0","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/zb5zx2adqx5t/6C8Uc6CvVW6HJpXNssMv5u/641d9ee743f69e87d89284a845336d2f/DSC_0312.JPG"}},"secondEntryTitle":"The first event","secondEntrySubtitle":"Introducing TechLabs at CBS!","secondEntryText":{"id":"b16af234-bc73-5920-9019-604799b3bd0d","json":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"In June it was time to have our very first event, the info evening to introduce TechLabs Copenhagen at CBS. The evening started with some networking, followed by an inspiring key note of Mark Wilson from Milestone. He advised us to use technology responsibly keeping always in mind to be sustainable, trustworthy, and profitable while putting the human being in the center of these three actions. After being stunned by his final words we started to introduce our TechLabs Copenhagen team and mission followed by walking through the Digital Shaper Program, our tracks, and the TechLabs journey. The evening was rounded up by a Get-Together with Mark, some of our mentors, and our future techies.

Thanks to Milestone Systems and Accenture, who are our premium partners for the fall semester 2019/2020, we are able to offer high quality online courses to our techies for free. Milestone Systems and Accenture will also be doing private talks and workshops throughout the semester to share professional tech-industry insights with our selected applicants. Furthermore, our techies will be accompanied by 7 experienced mentors with expertise in either Web Development, Data Science or AI who will help guide them through their projects.
