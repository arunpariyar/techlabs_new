At the moment most CBS study lines do not allow students to do technical IT electives because the courses need a clear link to business administration. However, the demand for business knowledge combined with technical IT skills is in exponential growth.”You’ve probably heard about data science, artificial intelligence and web development, but how do you actually learn it? Apply for the TechLabs Digital Shaper Program and enroll in one of the three tracks! Here you will join a group of fellow ambitious students, participate in tech-related talks and workshops and apply your skills in hands-on projects, while being supported by our experienced mentors. Our corporate sponsor Milestone Systems supplies us with expert-insights throughout the semester and has made sure the online courses are free.After completing your track and a final project you will receive a certificate and become a part of the TechLabs Copenhagen alumni network.

The evening started with some networking, followed by an inspiring key note of Mark Wilsson from Milestone. He advised us to use technology responsibly keeping always in mind to be sustainable, trustworthy and profitable while putting the human being in the center of these three actions. After being stunned by his final words we started to introduce our TechLabs Copenhagen team and mission followed by walking through the program, our tracks, meetings  and the TechLabs journey. The evening was rounded up by a Get-Together with Mark, some of our Mentors and our future Techies. This was a great first event and will be followed by another info evening on the 19th of September.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"thirdEntryImage":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/zb5zx2adqx5t/5vHYHZ6z29fjtNCzS3a67d/c285e13ec18cb4b2ce1e5428f67d6758/DSC_0283.JPG"}},"hasPartner":false,"partnerOne":null,"partnerTwo":null,"partnerThree":null,"partnerFour":null,"teamNameOne":null,"teamLinkedInOne":null,"teamImgOne":null,"teamNameTwo":null,"teamLinkedInTwo":null,"teamImgTwo":null,"teamNameThree":null,"teamLinkedInThree":null,"teamImgThree":null,"teamNameFour":null,"teamLinkedInFour":null,"teamImgFour":null,"openPositionsLink":null,"officeName":null,"officeImg":null,"officeAdress":null,"officeText":null,"officeLink":"info.cph@techlabs.org"},"allContentfulBlogPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"DocStation","id":"91c99299-bab7-5cca-99ec-86cfe9cebf07","readTime":8,"authorName":"Inside TechLabs","slug":"DocStation","abstract":"If you ever needed an appointment for a medical specialist, or simply live in a village where there aren’t enough doctors, you probably experienced some difficulties with finding a date in the near future.","postImg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/zb5zx2adqx5t/6biU3yCZei0hECaNmwnCW9/9f8082df34b1114d1598afd0b4b30bcb/0_um7tfAK9hOireSI7.png"}}}},{"node":{"title":"Bone age prediction through x-ray images","id":"e18911fe-8899-5d4d-915a-82e7ac7ebc7e","readTime":12,"authorName":"Inside TechLabs","slug":"BoneAgePrediction","abstract":"Applying deep learning based algorithms to medical imaging data such as x-rays, CT and MRI scans has proven itself a powerful method for a broad range of image diagnosis, recognition and classification tasks.","postImg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/zb5zx2adqx5t/3t2cLYiVp46bWyeAjoBU3S/828df90be30f6e8d42e93009286a4fba/0_3Z_1Gi7zm4qyu4Un.png"}}}},{"node":{"title":"Leaf Classification Project","id":"f0c2a38a-35b9-530b-ba09-c475a3801b58","readTime":11,"authorName":"Inside TechLabs","slug":"LeafClassificationProject","abstract":"While learning about AI at TechLabs, we realized a small project to classify plant species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).","postImg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/zb5zx2adqx5t/5ZXiuCpTpAYbs1ZZYZJCDC/935b18d8da2716bc11aebebdb26c3b39/1_WVKVADpoBBtmT2fZ3NA-aA.png"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"heading":"Copenhagen"}}
