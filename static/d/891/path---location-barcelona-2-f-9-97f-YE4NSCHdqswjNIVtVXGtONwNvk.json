Of course, having the proper coding skills in\nthis environment is of vital importance.

We\nwere overwhelmed with the large interest on campus and happy to welcome over 50\nstudents to our first semester. Over the course of six months, our students kept\nmaking impressive progress in their online courses, while working on their\nhands-on coding projects for the Digital Shaper Program. Further, we enjoyed\nregular meetups where we developed our skills, exchanged views about tech\ntopics, or just socialized over a few beers: A prototyping workshop with Le\nWagon, a visit of the Super Computer Mare Nostrum, ESADE’s famous campus party…\nthe list is long!
